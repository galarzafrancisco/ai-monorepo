# Comment task
Adds a comment to a task.
Make it somewhat detailed to keep track of what you're doing and what you've done.

Run `.claude/scripts/taskeroo/comment_task.sh "<task id>" "<your name>" "<comment text>"`

Alternatively, you can use the MCP server tool `mcp__taskeroo__add_comment` which provides the same functionality.

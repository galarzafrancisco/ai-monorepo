# Assign task
Assign a task to an agent, optionally tracking the work with a session id.

Provide the task id, the agent name, and optionally the session id the agent is working under.

Run `.claude/scripts/taskeroo/assign_task.sh "<task id>" "<assignee name>" [session id]`

Alternatively, you can use the MCP server tool `mcp__taskeroo__assign_task` which provides the same functionality.

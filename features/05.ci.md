# Test and GitHub Actions

## Description
I want to be able to tell if the app is ok after changes. To do that, we need tests.
Your goal is to create a lightweight end 2 end test suite and a github action to run it on PR.

# Requirements
- I must be able to run the test suit on my laptop
- Test suit must be able to run on a GitHub action runner
- Test suit built in typescript so we can expand it later
- Test:
  - Create task with no assignee
  - Create task with assignee
  - Fetch tasks - must see both
  - Fetch task by ID - must see one
  - Move the task without assignee to In Progress - must fail
  - Move the task with assignee to In Progress - must succeed
  - Add a comment to a task
  - Delete the task without comment
  - Fetch all tasks again. Must:
    - not see the one we deleted
    - see the one with the comment

# CI
- GitHub Action
- Must run on PR to main
- Must build the entire stack
- Must start the stack and run the test suite
- Must be able to see logs of the stack when the test fails

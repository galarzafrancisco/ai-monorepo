# MCP Registry UI

Based on the feature 08.mcp-registry.md.

Add a UI for this. Break it down into tasks so you can tackle one thing at the time.

- ui path should be /mcp-registry
- should have a dashboard showing a list of all servers
- clicking on a server should open a detailed page, with server id as a url nav. This detailed view should show the scopes, connections, and allow you to create connections, and allow you to create scopes, and allow you to map MCP scopes to connection scopes

- UI has the same styles as the rest of the page
- Uses a hook built on top of the generated clients, similar to the other hooks.

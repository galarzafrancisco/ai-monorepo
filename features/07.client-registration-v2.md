# Client registration v2

Revise the current implementation to:
- be more lax with the redirect uris -- I wanna use localhost and http and I'm seeing some validation errors
- Clients should be tailored to MCP Clients as defined in the spec: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization
  - grant types can only be authorization code and refresh token. No client_credentials
  - token endpoint auth method is only "none"
Decide if you want to enforce this in the DTO or the service.

## Tests
I haven't checked, but if you haven't added tests, add.
- Create client
- Retrieve client

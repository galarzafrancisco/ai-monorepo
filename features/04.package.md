# Package

## Description
I want to package this monorepo such that I can run it in one command.
Docker is what I'm thinking.

# Requirements
- I want to have a stable version of this running while I develop other versions, so I must be able to configure different ports
- I want to mount a persistent sqlite database
- I want to run a single process (no backend and frontend). To do that we probably need:
  - Compile the frontend into static files
  - Copy the static into a folder that the backend can serve
  - Modify the backend to serve the other stuff under an `/api/v1` prefix so it doesn't get confused with the statick content

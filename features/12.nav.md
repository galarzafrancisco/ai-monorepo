# Feature Request: Two-Layer Navigation System (App-level + In-app) for Desktop & Mobile

## Goal
Implement a scalable navigation system for a React SPA that supports:
- **App-level navigation** across top-level apps (Taskeroo, Wikiroo, MCP Registry, Agents, Settings, Logout)
- **In-app navigation** within a given app (starting with Taskeroo task-state sections)

The design must work across:
- Desktop (persistent sidebar)
- Mobile (hamburger drawer + optional bottom tabs per app)

This is foundational infrastructure and must be built in a way that scales to more apps and deeper in-app navigation without duplication or hacks.

---

## Non-goals
- Do not build full feature functionality for all apps; placeholders are fine.
- Do not introduce separate route trees for mobile vs desktop.
- Do not add manual API calls (no fetch/axios); backend integration is out of scope here.

---

## Navigation model

### 1) App-level navigation (global)
Top-level destinations:
- Home `/`
- Taskeroo `/taskeroo`
- Wikiroo `/wikiroo`
- MCP Registry `/mcp-registry`
- Agents `/agents`
- Settings `/settings`
- Logout `/logout`

**Requirements**
- App-level navigation is owned and rendered by the shell.
- The active app route is highlighted in navigation.
- Works in both desktop and mobile.

### 2) In-app navigation (local)
For Taskeroo only (initial implementation):
- Not started `/taskeroo/not-started`
- In progress `/taskeroo/in-progress`
- In review `/taskeroo/in-review`
- Done `/taskeroo/done`

**Requirements**
- In-app navigation is owned by the Taskeroo feature (declared via a contract).
- In-app sections are routable (deep links).
- In-app navigation is rendered differently per platform:
  - Mobile: bottom tabs
  - Desktop: tabs/segmented control region under the page title (or equivalent)

## Implementation requirements

### A) Shell responsibilities
**DesktopShell**
- Persistent left sidebar for app-level navigation.
- Main content area renders the routed page.
- Provide a de

# Prep

## Description
This feature is to adapt a largely copy-pasted codebase to our new project

## Background
- The copy-pasted code base had a backend -> bff -> UI architecture

## Tasks
- Remove any reference to the BFF and make it a 2 layer architecture
- Update readme to reflect this
- Remove anything referencing a pet store (former name) and make it ai-monorepo
- For the backend, implement a --generate-spec flag that when called, it doesn't start the webserver but does writeFileSync(document, path to openapi.json) to write the spec to a file
- Make an `npm run generate:spec` command for the backend that builds the app and starts it with the --generate-spec flag
- Update the readme to reflect this workflow for generating specs
- For the packages module, create the following npm commands:
  - `generate:types` openapi-typescript that reads contracts/openapi.json -o contracts/types.ts
  - `generate:client` openapi --input contractss/openapi.json --output src/client --client fetch

# Task ui

## Description
Modify taskeroo UI component to eliminate explicit fetch calls and rely on clients.
The clients are automatically generated based on annotations on the controllers and entities.

# Automatically generate clients

```bash
# From root
npm run generate:all
npm run build -w packages/shared
```

# Hook
I started creating `apps/ui/src/taskeroo/useTaskeroo.ts` with websocket logic and rest logic. It works quite well to retrieve tasks.

# Known bug
Currently when I create a task, it shows duplicated entries. I reckon is one due to the creation and another one coming from the websocket. Fix that.

# Your job:
- Go through all the UI components
- Identify explicit fetch calls (there are a couple to add comments for example)
- Replace that with the client generated. Put it in a hook if you'd like
- Ensure the app compiles and starts

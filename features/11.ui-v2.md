# Feature Request: Initialize React SPA UI Foundation (Vite + React + TypeScript)

## Goal
Create a new React single-page application with a **strong, scalable foundation** for a product that supports both **desktop and mobile** experiences in a single codebase. The focus is on **architecture, styling consistency, and theming**—not on feature completeness.

This app will be accessed in a browser, and on mobile it may be pinned as an iOS home-screen shortcut (PWA-like feel).

---

## Non-goals
- Do not build a full design system or complete product UI.
- Do not implement backend authentication flows; assume auth is a cookie set by backend.
- Do not implement manual API calls (`fetch`, `axios`, etc.). Backend interactions must use shared generated clients (wired later).
- Do not add lots of UI flourishes. Keep it minimal, consistent, and correct.

---

## Requirements (Foundational)

### 1) Technology
- Use **React + TypeScript** with **Vite**.
- Use a modern React router (route-based pages).
- Use CSS that supports **design tokens (CSS variables)** and **multiple themes**.

### 2) Architecture (must follow)
Implement a layered architecture:

- `app/`
  - routing
  - providers (theme, etc.)
  - shells (desktop/mobile)
- `ui/`
  - primitives (Stack, Row, Text, Button, Card, etc.)
  - base styling foundations (tokens)
- `features/`
  - feature modules (taskeroo, wikiroo, agents, mcp-registry)
  - feature-specific pages and components
- `shared/` (or equivalent)
  - placeholder location where generated clients would be imported later
  - (no actual backend calls required in this scaffold)

**Boundaries**
- `ui/` must not import from `features/`.
- `features/` may import from `ui/`.
- Pages must be thin compositions.

### 3) Desktop + Mobile in one app
- Use a **single routing tree**.
- Implement **shell abstraction**:
  - `DesktopShell`
  - `MobileShell`
- The shell is responsible for layout chrome (header/nav/safe area).
- Pages must render inside either shell without being rewritten.

**Responsiveness**
- Layout responsiveness must be **CSS-first** (media queries).
- JS-based viewport checks allowed only for behavioral differences (use sparingly).

### 4) Theming and style system
Implement a token-driven theme system:

- Design tokens via CSS variables:
  - `--bg`, `--surface`, `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--border`, `--accent`, `--danger`, etc.
  - spacing scale `--space-1..--space-8`
  - radius scale `--r-1..--r-4`
  - focus ring token `--focus-ring`
- Themes are switched using `data-theme` on the `html` element.
- Include at least **three themes**:
  - `light`
  - `dark`
  - one additional theme (e.g., `github` or `forest`)
- Components must use tokens (no hardcoded colors like “green”, no hex values outside token files).

### 5) UI primitives (minimum set)
Create a minimal, consistent primitive set used throughout:
- `Stack` (vertical layout)
- `Row` (horizontal layout)
- `Text` (typography)
- `Button` and `IconButton`
- `Card`
- `Divider`
- `Link` wrapper if needed (router-aware)
- `ListRow` (GitHub-style row container for lists)

Primitives should:
- have small, intentional variants (`size`, `tone`, etc.)
- implement focus-visible states consistently

---

## Routes & Pages

### 1) Home page `/`
Implement a simple home page with links to:
- `/taskeroo`
- `/wikiroo`
- `/mcp-registry`
- `/agents`
- `/logout`

Notes:
- `logout` can be a placeholder page or route for now (no backend call).
- The home page should be built using primitives (ListRow or Card list).

### 2) Taskeroo page `/taskeroo`
Implement the initial Taskeroo page foundation.

**Objective:** Provide a clean starting screen that demonstrates the system:
- Uses primitives
- Uses tokens
- Works in mobile + desktop shells
- Shows consistent list styling similar to GitHub-style rows

**Taskeroo UI (initial)**
- Header/title: “Taskeroo”
- A list of placeholder tasks (hardcoded in code for now, no backend calls)
  - each task row should display:
    - title
    - optional status badge (e.g., “Open”, “In progress”)
    - optional metadata line (e.g., “Created by X • Assigned to Y • 3 comments”)
  - left gutter area in each row reserved for future icons/avatars (space should exist even if placeholder)
- Include empty state behavior (if list is empty, show a clean empty state message).
- Ensure tap targets are good on mobile.

**No detail page required yet** unless trivial to stub.

---

## Acceptance criteria

### Foundation correctness
- App compiles and runs with Vite.
- Architecture directories exist and boundaries are respected.
- No manual API calls exist anywhere.
- Theme system works, with at least 3 themes.
- Tokens are used everywhere (no raw green/hex usage in component styles).

### UX correctness
- Home page renders links correctly and navigation works.
- Taskeroo page renders a GitHub-like list of tasks.
- The UI looks coherent under:
  - desktop viewport
  - mobile viewport
- Shells wrap pages correctly (no duplicated route tree).

### Review checklist compliance
All changes must satisfy the “UI Change Review Guide” from the principles document, especially:
- semantic token usage (`accent`, not `green`)
- no hardcoded spacing
- CSS-first responsiveness
- primitives-first composition

---

## Deliverables
- New Vite React TS project with the structure described
- Theme tokens + 3 themes
- DesktopShell + MobileShell switching based on viewport
- Home page with required links
- Taskeroo page with placeholder task list using GitHub-like rows
- Minimal primitive library sufficient for the above pages
- Short README describing how to run and how themes are applied
